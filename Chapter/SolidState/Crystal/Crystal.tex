Solids that can be described as crystal are called polycrystalline; these material are actually composed of small crystalline grains.
This collection of crystal--or grains--have their own orientation.
The interface of two grains with different orientation are called grain boundary and this can often make the crystal have more mechanical strength.

On the other hand, solids that  characterized by the absence of any long-range order are called amorphous. 
Without order, their atomic structure cannot form grain, thus they do not have grain boundary.
